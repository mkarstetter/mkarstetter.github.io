      <h3>About Ancient Lake Outfitters</h3>
      <p>
        Ancient Lakes Outfitters is based out of Quincy, WA and spends a
        majority of the year in the immediate surrounding area. However we will
        and do travel to Moses Lake, Othello and other surrounding areas as well
        to be where the birds are.
      </p>
      <p>Ancient Lakes Outfitters is owned and operated by Tyson Karstetter.</p>
      <p>
        Tyson has been in the heart of the Columbia Basin since day one. Some
        good friends got him into chasing birds at a young age where the
        addiction first began. He has 7+ years of experience as a guide. In the
        off season Tyson spends the rest of the year working for the family
        farm. Having this farming background sure helps when it comes to leasing
        ground and gaining permission to hunt wherever the birds may be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ancient Lakes Outfitters is a quality over quantity style service,
        setting the bar high to have successful trips in the field. We scout
        hundreds of miles a week to find fresh feeds and ensure that our clients
        are given a quality experience.
