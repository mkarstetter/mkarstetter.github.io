      <h3>Here Is Our Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Here at Ancient Lakes, we want to offer you a fun filled and stress free
        experience day in and day out.A $100 dollar non refundable deposit per
        gun will be required at the time of booking to reserve yuor spot. We
        understand that life happens, and are willing to work with you on a per
        case basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have a five daycancelation policy that allows you to reschedule and
        put your deposit towards a future day in the field with us. Anything
        under the five day cancellation window will be forfeited from the
        deposit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes mother nature can be extremely unpredictable. This can cause
        passes and road closures. Tyson will be staying in contact with you in
        the days leading up to your trip so that everyone in your party can plan
        accordingly. We understand that sometimes weather can prohibit travel
        and hunting opportunities, if something like this happens Tyson will be
        in contact wit hyou about rescheduling as well as figuring out what
        other options are available.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not do refunds. Our trips are typically very successful, but given
        the nature of hunting, there are no guarantees.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are still hunting wild game and while booking a trip with us will
        significantly increase your odds of having a successful trip, nothing is
        ever guaranteed. We encourage everyone to book a two day trip if
        possible to help allow yourself or group the best possible chance at
        making it a successful trip to remember!
